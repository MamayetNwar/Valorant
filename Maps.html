                </figure>
            <p>
                    Pearl is a two-site three-lane map. 
                    Following on from the release of more strategically complex maps like Icebox, Breeze, and Fracture, Pearl is designed as a more traditional map. 
                    As a result, Pearl is the first map to be released that does not contain any dynamic elements or mechanical hooks for gameplay.

                <h2><font color="darkblue">Icebox</font></h2>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                    Icebox is a unique map in Valorant due to its narrow corridors, abundance of verticality, and emphasis on a single teamwide execute. 
                    This map can easily trip up new players who are more used to a free-flowing game on maps like Haven, Bind, or Ascent.

                            Two bomb spots, a middle area, and a lot of connecting areas in between. 
                            The defenders have a clear-cut path two both spots. 
                            Via Side Arches and A Bridge, they can access the sites long before any attacker arrives. 
                            The middle features wide open spaces and a lot of angles for Operator players.
