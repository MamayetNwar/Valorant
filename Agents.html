            <p>
            <font face="Comic Sans MS">Duelists are self-sufficient fraggers who their team expects, through abilities and skills, to get high frags and seek out engagements first. 
            Duelists are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. 
            Agents under this role have abilities that allow them to focus on being the first to enter sites and engage the enemy.</font>

            <p>
            <font face="Comic Sans MS">Controllers are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. 
                The abilities of agents under this role allow them to assist their teammates by cutting enemy vision, taking control of an area, and forcing enemies into choke points. 
                The game currently has four Controller agents in its roster.</font>

            <p>
            <font face="Comic Sans MS">Initiators are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. 
                The abilities of agents under this role focus on flushing enemies out of hiding spots and corners in order to assist the team when charging into battle. 
                The game currently has five Initiator agents in its roster.</font>

            <p>
            <font face="Comic Sans MS">Sentinels are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. 
                The abilities of agents under this role focus on defensive play, with emphasis on supporting the rest of the team through providing intel, 
                anchoring down sites, and preventing the enemy from flanking.</font>
